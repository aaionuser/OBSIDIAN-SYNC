The worst thing you can do is to passively consume. You arent doing anything and you arent even resting, yet you are tiring yourself for not even a single output, and thats a terrible habit to teach your brain.. Indeed, the dangerous thing is that while we consume passively our brain is deceived into thinking its on a meaningful journey, but the truth is, we are just damaging ourselves!
