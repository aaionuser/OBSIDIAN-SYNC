Average reading is set to be about 200–250 words per minute. In order to go faster, how your eyes and brain process text need to be changed. Instead of you "hearing" the words in your head then chnage it to "seeing" the meaning.

1. The "Subvocalization" Bottleneck
The vital thing that is slowing you down is a "background process" called Subvocalization. This is that little voice in your head that "speaks" the words as you read them.
 * The Problem: Your brain can think much faster than you can speak. If you "say" every word in your head, you are limited to talking speed (approx. 150–200 WPM).
 * The Fix: You need to treat words like pictures. When you see a "Stop" sign, you don't say "S-T-O-P" in your head; you just know what it means instantly. Practice looking at words and grabbing the meaning without "sounding them out."
2. The "Regression" Error (Stop Looking Back)
One of the most inefficient "design flaws" in human reading is Regression—when your eyes skip back to a previous sentence because you think you missed something.
 * The Solution: Use a "Pacer." Take a pen, your finger, or even a bookmark and move it steadily under the line you are reading.
 * The Rule: Your eyes must follow the pacer. Do not let your eyes jump back. This forces your brain to pay more attention the first time (The "Interrupt" command).
3. Peripheral Vision (The "Chunking" Algorithm)
Instead of reading word-by-word, start reading groups of words.
 * The Method: Your eye has a focus area. If you look at the center of a sentence, your peripheral vision can see the words to the left and right.
 * The Goal: Try to "snapshot" 3 or 4 words at once. Instead of 10 "eye jumps" per line, try to finish a line in only 2 or 3 "jumps."
4. Practice Exercises to Boost WPM
 * The "Soft Focus" Drill: Pick a book you’ve already read. Try to finish a page in 30 seconds. Don't worry about "getting it all"; just train your eyes to move faster than they are comfortable with.
 * The "Center-Line" Technique: Draw two vertical lines down a page, about 2 inches apart. Try to keep your eyes only between those lines. Your peripheral vision will pick up the words on the edges.
 * RSVP Apps (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation): Use apps like Spreeder or Readsy. They flash words on the screen one at a time at high speeds. This "forces" your brain to stop subvocalizing because it simply doesn't have time to "say" the words.
5. The "Reality Snap": Speed vs. Comprehension
In DAA, there is always a trade-off. In reading, it is Speed vs. Retention.
 * The Trap: If you "speed read" a complex philosophy book or a physics textbook, you might hit 700 WPM, but your "Data Save" success rate will be 0%.
 * The Strategy: * Scan/Skim: For news, emails, and fluff (High speed).
   * Deep Read: For learning, complex logic, and emotional literature (Normal speed).
