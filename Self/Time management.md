1. We own our time - we are in control of our time, we always feel like we dont really have that much time but in reality we do have time, its just that we need to know what we are going to use our time for, and if you dont have time for something meaning that the thing is basically not a priority...

2. "Hell yeah or no" principle - this principle is teaching us how to learn to say no to opportunities that arent enthusiastic to us, as a result this will avoid us from filling up the things that might filled up our calender but sooner regret for wasting time..

3. The daily highlight - its feels great to do the thing that you are really enthusiastic with and that is why you need to put it as the first thing, this is going to act as a highlight the first important thing you need to do that day, focusing on this task will help you ensure that the task get done...

4. Use to-do list - write down the task that you need to accomplish today, so that it will ease your mind for more ideas to come..

5. Time-blocking - once you know what you need to accomplish today and the next day, its time for you to schedule specific block of time for your tasks in the calendar especially the important task such as daily highlighted task.

6. Parkinson law - sounds weird but this a harsh reality,but the thing is when you are doing something, its better if you set a dateline some sort of timer, so that you know that you need to finish that specific act the given timeframes, this can prevent us from doing the one single act for a long time...

7. Protected time - you specify a time period for example "i want my morning to be free of distraction", this will make you focus more the personal activities..

8. The choice to be satisfied - at the end of the day, all that is matter is whether you act on it or not, years of planning wont get you anywhere without action..
