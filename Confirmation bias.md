## What is it?
Confirmation bias in a simple term is a decision making situation that you make in daily life where you just assume that what you believe for is actually the truth when there are so many evidence, proof and data that correlate to it while the reality is let say some data shows contradiction, you quickly disagree with it and just using the old believe that you follow..

## Why does it matter?
It does matter as it help in making decision and combating bias, since we tend to think that something is right based on what we think, that is the reason why we cant establish connection with people, as for this one example where burma want to get her health check and she doesnt even know what kind of disease shes been infecting with, and the doctor has been asking the same question linked to anorexia, yet burma dont believe that, yes he lost the appetite on food but its because of the disease, shes not doing it on purpose..

### Why do we have confirmation bias
Its all comes to our survival instinct, for example if we went to the forest, and we want to find food, then at forest 1 we found banana, but because we wanted to combat conformation bias we think that "there must be another banana in another forest", so we go to forest 2 and found banana too, well it might be good, but let say if we already hungry at that time, we might die because we are to picky on choosing the banana in forest 1..

## 2-4-6 sequence technique
So whenever you are trying to make a decision on something, remember to always think twice, consider other possibilities, so that you not jump straight to single cause fallacy..
