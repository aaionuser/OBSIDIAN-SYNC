## Purpose of studying
For your timing/scheduling, consider the pomodoro method.
For motivation, write yourself a paragraph or page (length doesn’t matter) of why it’s important for you to study. Why do you want to, why it will be useful later and why that matters and so on.

## Study technique
Check out the book “make it stick”, or the one called “a mind for numbers.
If you prefer an easy free course. Check coursera’s learning how to learn.
Or check YouTube Ali abdaal or med school insides.
Tons of ways to learn to study.  You’ll have to try a few before you find what works for you, but it is well worth it
