Human need sleep, infact sleep is a way for us to recharge and reset back our body. Since we spend our whole day working, in that sense, we tend to use a lot of energy from our body. Turns out that sleep helps us to relax our muscle thus prevent it from getting tense. Quality sleep is what we aim for and there are multiple factors that contribute to this which are the way you sleep(sleep position), our behaviour before sleep(habits before sleep), sleep environment, and many other minor factors that we will be discuss later... 

I have been observing my sleep pattern and i am going to break it down into two parts, which is the first part is during my time at home and the second one is during my time at the university.

So let us look at the first part which is during my time at home, it is obvious to me that whenever i sleep at let say 11-12pm or perhaps a little early than that, i find out that yes i will wake up upon the ringing of the alarm, unfortunately, my hand reaches the the phone to stopped it.. its weird because, i am completely concious at the time, its just my action not allign with my though, and there is actually a terms for this in psychology field which is [[cognitve dissonance]], and ended up i woke almost at 9 - 11pm every single days.. 

Then let us look at the second part which is during my time at the university, at this time around i felt like i am a different person, lucky me, i have my roommate that always woke up early at 5am every day, and i think that this is probably the reason why i am also woke up 5:00-5:30am every day.. its kind of fascinating, because sudden change in environment really does make a different.. 

Yet there are so many approach that i use to overcome this issue though, to think that it even possible for me to have two separate part in sleeping? And how do i actually repair it? I mean if we look at today's leaders right, they always woke up early than any body, even sleeping only for a short period of time. Crazy isnt it? How actually does those leader develop that habits..

A couple days forward, there are multiple approach to how i tend to combat this issue which one of them is following all the sunnah... "it was 12:50-ish in the morning", i am planning to sleep and also overthinking that i might not be able to wake up since it was late and my previous observation already justify this that i will wake up late.. well, i remember something in that moment, which is the sentence that kept appearing in my head and thag sentence is "there will be someone that are truly care about their plan for that day no matter what happen!", this sparked me an idea where i need to just do the thing which in this case just complete action without thinking about it twice.. and that is what i did, i took an ablution, recite three qul and voila, i just when to sleep..  It turns out that i kind of woken up to my first alarm but i instanly snooze it off, and gladly i am able to woke up to my alarm at 5:40am for congrational subh prayer...

Thursday, january 8, the same thing happened, yes i did wake up to the subh prayer alarm, and i did perform subh prayer. But the problem a rise when i went back to sleep after i finish performing the prayer! Well there must be a reason right? Am i restless because of driving last night? Sleeping on the floor is painful? No i dont think so, i got to sleep early last night like probably 11pm or so.. But think about it, why do i went to sleep a moment after i finished the prayer? The real answer is because, i dont have [[purpose]] that morning.. i felt like i wanted to skip everything that morning, i dont know what to do and that is why i just went to sleep.. and its just a simple hypothesis, "no purpose means no action"..

Ralated terminology:
[[Sleep inertia]]
[[cognitve dissonance]]
[[Social anchoring]]
[[Contextual identity]]
[[Spiritual mindfulness]]
[[Behavioural activation]]
