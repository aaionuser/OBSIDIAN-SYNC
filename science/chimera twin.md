[incident] 
there is this one incident where there was a man married to this one woman, they lived a happy life and have 4 children, yet on the 5 child, he decided to do a [[DNA test]]. Shocking, he found out that all of his children were not from his own DNA.. Apparently, the reason why he did the DNA test is not because he dont trust his wife, infact he even said that his wife is ''the best in the world'', but the truth is his fourth child got into health problem that require the child to do a blood transfusion, of course the father wanted to helped him out, and since the blood type is not the same to his son, that is the reason why he did a DNA test.. After a few argument with his wife, blaming that her wife cheated, even after how many rejection saying that she is always loyal to him, he decided to broke up with her leaving his wife with all of his children by themselves.. 

Not long after 6 years, he found his lover and decided to get married, luckily they got their first children.. WIll the lightning struck the same  place twice? it seems like it.. And so he did the procedure back and find out that this children does not have the same DNA as him, well how unfortunate he is, his wife also insisted that she does not cheat to him.. After a few test on him were conducted, scientist found out that the man actually have a twin but inside him.. it was actually a chimera twin, and during the fetus phase, he actually ate his brother and thats why the sperm is actually was not his but instead his brother DNA... 

The truth is, how many marriage were broken because of this complexity, all in all, dear husband, make sure that you make your own research on your body first before making a decision...
